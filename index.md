### Hello

It is, perhaps, both customary and mildly disconcerting to begin with one’s own name, but in the interests of clarity (a virtue occasionally prized in both the public and private sectors), allow me to introduce myself: I am C V Krishna Murthy.
My professional trajectory, if one may so describe a sequence of decisions governed by equal parts ambition, intellectual curiosity, and administrative serendipity, has spanned the technocratic, the financial, and the strategic. From the intricate syntax of software code to the delicately poised spreadsheets of investment banking, and onwards to the executive abstractions of product strategy, I have sought to bring a systems-oriented approach to the art and science of structured problem-solving.
More succinctly put (though I hesitate to be overly economical with words), I operate best where disciplines converge, and where ambiguity is not a hurdle but an invitation to think more clearly.

### On Professional Engagements

In the course of my engagements, I have contributed to the construction of investment theses for mid-market mergers and acquisitions, collaborated with global teams on product roadmaps at Amazon, and in the earlier chapters of my career, architected software systems designed to scale with both elegance and efficiency.
Presently, my interests lie in the fruitful tri-junction of strategy, artificial intelligence, and operational execution—domains which, when orchestrated judiciously, enable organisations to harmonise short-term outcomes with long-term strategic value. My modus operandi involves analytical precision, conceptual clarity, and the occasionally radical notion that first principles do, in fact, still matter.

### On Educational Credentials

In terms of formal education, I hold an MBA from XLRI Jamshedpur and a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani—institutions which, I am reliably informed, are held in some regard. I am also a Mensa Fellow (though I do try not to bring it up at dinner parties) and an AWS Certified AI Practitioner, credentials which have proved occasionally useful when navigating both technical discussions and algorithmic mysticism.

### Matters Beyond the Brief

Beyond professional commitments, I find both refuge and inspiration in history—particularly in the long view of institutions, systems, and civilisations. I write when I can, as a means of organising thoughts otherwise prone to strategic drift, and I take a somewhat impractical interest in horology, or the study of fine timepieces.
I remain drawn, above all, to the ideal of public impact achieved through structured reasoning and disciplined execution—an aspiration not without its challenges, but, I would argue, all the more worthwhile for them.
