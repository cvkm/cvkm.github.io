### Hello

I’m C V Krishna Murthy. That’s the formal bit.
I’ve worked across tech, finance, and strategy, valuing companies, shaping products. If there's a messy problem at the intersection of disciplines, that’s usually where I’m happiest.

### What I do
From building investment theses for M&A to working with FAANG on product roadmaps, and earlier, writing code that actually scaled, I bring a systems lens to business questions.
Right now, I’m focused on strategy, AI, and execution. When these click together, short-term wins and long-term value stop competing, and start compounding.

### Background
MBA from XLRI Jamshedpur, B.E. from BITS Pilani. I usually don’t lead with those, but they help explain the mix of logic and curiosity.

### Off the clock
Big fan of history. I write to make sense of ideas. And yes, I have a soft spot for horology, watchmaking’s elegant obsession with time.
At the core, I care about creating public impact through clear thinking and structured action. Still a work in progress, but that’s the goal.
